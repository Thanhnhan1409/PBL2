The movie version is a love story revolving around the fateful couple Bhop (Thanavat Vatthanaputi) and Gaysorn (Ranee Campen) with the main setting in the Rattanakosin era (1782-1855). In fact, they are the descendants who were reincarnated after hundreds of years of Dej and Karaket - the two main characters in the TV series who lived in the Ayutthaya era (1351-1767).
