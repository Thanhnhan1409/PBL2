The Nun is set in a Romanian monastery in 1952, before the events of "The Conjuring" and "Annabelle". After the bizarre and mysterious death of a young nun at the convent, a priest with a haunting past and an unfulfilled pastor are finally sent by the Vatican to investigate the matter. Together, they discover a terrible truth. Not only facing life-threatening danger, the two also have to face the threat of faith and soul before a cruel force disguised as a demonic nun.
