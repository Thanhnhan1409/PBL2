Avatar is the story of a "reluctant" hero Jake Sully - a former Marine officer who is partially paralyzed. He is selected to participate in the gene transplant program with the alien Na';vi to create a new species that can breathe the air on the planet Pandora. This new breed is called Avatar. After becoming an Avatar, Jake is tasked with finding out and researching the planet Pandora. The information he collected is very valuable for the campaign to invade this second blue planet of mankind.
